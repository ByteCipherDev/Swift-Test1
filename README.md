Functionality:-

1. In given three boxes contain their separate values. e.g Box1, Box2 and Box3
So your task is that when we change box1, box2, and box3 values separately from given text fields in given Figma designs also you have to set those values on boxes accordingly.

for e.g when I change box1 values from text fields its value appears on box1 and text fields are empty after the change. same for box2 and box3.

2. When we click on the "Change random values" button, The values of box1, box2, and box3 are changed from Randomisation.
